## Abstract
In this paper we deal with automatic generation of image captions by using multiple types of neural networks. Thesis is based on the papers from MS COCO Captioning Challenge 2015 and character language models, popularized by A. Karpathy. Proposed model is combination of convolutional and recurrent neural network with encoderâ€“decoder architecture. Vector representing encoded image is passed to language model as memory values of first LSTM layer of the network. This work investigate, whether model with such simple architecture is more suitable than other contemporary solutions for languages different than English.
