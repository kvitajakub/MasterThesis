## Abstract
In this paper we deal with automatic generation of image captions by using multiple kinds of neural networks. Study is based on the papers from MS COCO Captioning Challenge 2015 and character language models, popularized by A. Karpathy. Proposed model is combination of convolutional and recurrent neural network with encoderâ€“decoder architecture. Vector with image representation is passed to language model as memory values of first LSTM layer of the network. This thesis investigate, whether model with such simple architecture can compete with other contemporary solutions.
